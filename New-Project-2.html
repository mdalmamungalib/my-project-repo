					<h1>Out-of-control SpaceX rocket on collision course with moon</h1>
					<p>A SpaceX rocket is on a collision course with the moon after spending almost seven years hurtling through space, experts say.

	The booster was originally launched from Florida in February 2015 as part of an interplanetary mission to send a space weather satellite on a million-mile journey.

	But after completing a long burn of its engines and sending the NOAA’s Deep Space Climate Observatory on its way to the Lagrange point – a gravity-neutral position four times farther than the moon and in direct line with the sun – the rocket’s second stage became derelict.
